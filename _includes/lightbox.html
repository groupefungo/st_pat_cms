                        is relatively easy for French and/or English speakers to master.</p>
                    <p>In the Spanish Profile, students will get to interact orally, understand, read, and produce a
                        variety of texts in the Spanish language. These competencies are complementary and are
                        developed in synergy.</p>
                    <p>Students will learn through different class activities in a very dynamic and interactive approach.
                        Learning will be done through role play, activities, use of technology, contextualization and
                        educational outings among others. Students will get opportunities to explore the Spanish
                        culture in presence of native speakers and organizations such as «Salsa sans Frontières».</p>
                    <p>As students take responsibility for developing their own competencies, they are to participate
                        actively in the learning process and become involved in interaction, comprehension and
                        production tasks. They must take initiative and make an effort to communicate in Spanish as
                        often as possible, as well as demonstrate creativity.</p>
