                    <p>Woodworking is the art or craft that focuses on creating or fashioning objects out of wood. The
                        materials can range from a rudimentary bench to intricate pieces of furniture.</p>
                    <p>The Woodworking Profile will enable students to acquire the knowledge, skills and attitude
                        essential to perform woodworking tasks. Students will learn how to manipulate and transform
                        wood, as well as other materials. Through progressive hands-on activities students will develop
                        their craftsmanship and study the different stages involved in the creation process. Students
                        will be taught how to handle and use specific tools in a safe manner. Woodworking requires a
                        lot of patience, creativity and dexterity and can sometimes be a physically challenging
                        activity.</p>
                    <p>Students will be expected to frequently reflect upon their learning so that they become able to
                        recognize their strengths and limitations, and to expand their abilities. </p>

                    <h3>Payment</h3>
                    <p>Once a player has been selected on an LHPS team, we are asking for a $500 commitment payment. The
                        rest of the fees can be paid at the beginning of the next school year.</p>
                    <h3>On Ice Practices</h3>
                    <p>All the on ice practices are taking place in the morning or right after school at the Peps (Laval
                        University); there is no session at night. We privilege this approach to ensure that players
                        have time for school work and other activities of their own. When practices occur after school,
                        players have to leave class 25 minutes before the end of Period 4 (2:45 pm). Players will have
                        to make the necessary arrangements with their teachers. Players are not missing school for
                        practices in the morning as it built in their school timetable.</p>
                    <p>Players can leave their bag in the Team locker room at all time. We are extremely lucky that the
                        Peps agreed to let us use the old locker room of the Rouge et Or Football program. The locker
                        room has since been modified to accommodate hockey teams.</p>
                    <h3>Off Ice Training</h3>
                    <p>The off ice training takes place once week after school from 3:15 pm to 4:30 pm. All sessions are
                        performed under the supervision of an instructor from ‘’Elite Factor’’, an organization that
                        specializes in providing fitness programs to athletes from different elite structures.</p>
                    <p>Players will be following a fitness program that is adapted to their needs. Players will follow a
                        fitness program that will ensure an optimal progression.</p>
                    <h3>Games</h3>
                    <p>The games are played mostly on weekends.</p>
                    <p>The LHPS being provincial league, teams come from everywhere. In order to not always be on the
                        road, the league uses a lot of what they call ‘’showcases’’. A showcase consists of playing 2 to
                        3 matches on a day or 2 (3 games = 2 days, 2 games = 1 or 2 days). With this format, all the
                        teams get together at one place in the province and play their games on a given weekend. This
                        prevents from playing a game, for example, on a Saturday in Lévis and then the next day play in
                        Montreal. By having games condensed this way, players will not play matches at all weekends.
                        They will also often have a day off per weekend (i.e. Saturday or Sunday) so there is still more
                        time for study or for family activities.</p>
                    <h3>Academic Advisor</h3>
                    <p>Players will by meeting two to three times a week with their academic advisor on mornings when we
                        do not practice. Before the start of the hockey season, players will meet one by one with the
                        coaching staff and their academic advisor to set up goals for the upcoming school year. These
                        goals will be determined accordingly to the student’s results from previous years. The role of
                        the academic advisor is to ensure that players are meeting their objectives. If these objectives
                        are not meet by the student, the academic advisor determines the measures to be put in place in
                        order to help the student.</p>

                    <p>The Music Profile is all about playing music.</p>
                    <p>The music teacher and specialists (professional musicians from the Quebec City area) work very
                        closely with our students in small groups (max. 10). We also offer private lessons as part of
                        the
                        Music Profile package. We feel that this is the optimal formula for helping students develop the
                        skills necessary to express themselves musically.</p>
                    <p>The choices for study are vocals and/or a musical instrument. The instruments offered are:
                        saxophone, clarinet, trumpet, trombone, guitar, piano, bass and drums. We supply the
                        instruments free of charge. (guitar players must have their own instrument).</p>
                    <p><strong>There is a strong jazz and blues component to our program!<br>No previous musical
                        experience is required unless auditioning for guitar or piano.</strong></p>
                    <p>The assignment of instruments and acceptance into the vocal component of the profile will be
                        determined in auditions held at the beginning of the school year.</p>
                    <p>Students enrolled in Music Profile will be part of a Jazz Band and/or a vocal ensemble (ie.
                        Pentatonix). The ensembles will be performing at evening concerts in December and May as well
                        as having the possibility to perform at the CQSB Arts Festival, Jazzfest des jeunes de Québec,
                        local Elementary Schools and more.</p>
                    <p>In the past, the St. Pat’s Jazz Band has traveled to and played in <strong>Havana, New Orleans,
                        Cleveland, Toronto, Ottawa, Halifax, and New York City</strong>.</p>
                    <p>Students will also study other features of musical production, including basic recording
                        techniques (we have a 16 track recording studio at St. Pat’s), basic technical lighting,
                        publicity,
                        etc. Whenever possible, guest musicians are invited to perform and discuss their career with
                        the students.</p>

                        training, students will discover different facets of the sports involved, and acquire the skills

                        is relatively easy for French and/or English speakers to master.</p>
                    <p>In the Spanish Profile, students will get to interact orally, understand, read, and produce a
                        variety of texts in the Spanish language. These competencies are complementary and are
                        developed in synergy.</p>
                    <p>Students will learn through different class activities in a very dynamic and interactive
                        approach.
                        Learning will be done through role play, activities, use of technology, contextualization and
                        educational outings among others. Students will get opportunities to explore the Spanish
                        culture in presence of native speakers and organizations such as «Salsa sans Frontières».</p>
                    <p>As students take responsibility for developing their own competencies, they are to participate
                        actively in the learning process and become involved in interaction, comprehension and
                        production tasks. They must take initiative and make an effort to communicate in Spanish as
                        often as possible, as well as demonstrate creativity.</p>
                    <p>Students will work together with one goal in mind: <strong>to be able to use the Spanish language
                        in a
                        real life context</strong>.</p>
