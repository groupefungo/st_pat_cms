      <p>Support services for students with special needs are designed to help students with learning difficulties to maximize their potential for academic, social and vocational success. Support services can take the form of small group instruction, individual tutorials and in-class support. In addition, St. Patrick's maintains the services of Special Education Technicians that may work individually with students.</p>
      <p>The Central Quebec School Board <a href="https://www.cqsb.qc.ca/en/commitees/special-needs-committee" target="_blank">Special Needs Advisory Committee</a> is a strong believer in inclusion. The regular class is available to all special needs students.</p>
      <p>Parents with students of special needs are stongly encouraged to mark on their registration forms for their child the need for special need services. This allows time for a dossier to be compiled that must be submitted to the Ministry of Education for approval. Without such a dossier, and its subsequent approval our ability to offer services to your child will be limited. Please contact the guidance counselor Sandra Hughes (525-8421) for further information.</p>
      <p>The following links are provided as resources for teachers, professionals and most importantly, parents with children who have special needs. They have been compiled here on one page so that it may act as an up to date resource. Please note that although we have provided these links, do not assume that we support, endorse or recommend any method, treatment, product, remedial centre, programme or person that you may discover in these links. We encourage you to inform yourselves appropriately.</p>
