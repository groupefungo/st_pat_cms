Dear Parents,

1. Our 1st term report card night is on Wednesday November 13th, from 4:30-7:30 PM
2. Once again, we are using the online appointment system. [Click Here](https://stpats.schoolappointments.com/)

We HIGHLY recommend that you register and add your child(ren) before the system officially opens for appointments.

The system will open for appointments as of 6:00 AM, Wednesday, November 6th and will remain open until Wednesday, November 13th, 9:00AM.

If you are the parent of twins, the system will not permit you to schedule back to back meetings with any specific teacher. You may call the secretary to have her help in this circumstance.

**Report Cards**

Will be published on Friday, November 8th.

In order to access the report card, as a parent you will need to log in to the [Parent Portal](https://portailparents.ca/accueil/en/).

If, as a parent, you have NOT created an account with the parent portal [here](https://portailparents.ca/accueil/en/aide.htm) are the instructions for doing so.

We hope to see you there on Report Card Night.
