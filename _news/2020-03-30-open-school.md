Dear students and parents, as promised by the Minister of Education, a web site was created for you where thousands of resources for learning and staying active can be found.

The activities are designed to allow everyone to complete them on their own or with support from their friends and families.

You can choose your own adventure based on your knowledge and grade level.

New activities will be added regularly to help you enjoy every day of learning.

Here is where you can get to the website:
